# Open Weather API Demo

Demonstration of using the Open Weather API forecast endpoint and icons to view weather forecast for a given city.

## Video Walk Through

I made this on a live-stream. Some shortcuts were taken to keep the total time required minimized. (Adjustments for time-zone weren't made. Input validation isn't great. etc.)

## Setup/Running

Open `app.js` and replace `OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY` with an API key for the Open Weather API. Go to [OpenWeatherMap API guide](https://openweathermap.org/guide) to register for a key.

Clone/download this repo and open `index.html` in a major browser. (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
